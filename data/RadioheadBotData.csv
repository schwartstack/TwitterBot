Creep,"When you were here before. Couldn't look you in the eye. You're just like an angel. Your skin makes me cry. You float like a feather. In a beautiful world. I wish I was special. You're so fuckin' special. But I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I don't belong here. I don't care if it hurts. I wanna have control. I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul. I want you to notice. When I'm not around. You're so fuckin' special. I wish I was special. But I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I don't belong here. Oh, oh. She's running out the door. She's running out. She run, run, run, run. Run. Whatever makes you happy. Whatever you want. You're so fuckin' special. I wish I was special. But I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I don't belong here. I don't belong here"
Karma Police,"Karma police, arrest this man. He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge. He's like a detuned radio. Karma police, arrest this girl. Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill.

No Surprises,"A heart that's full up like a landfill. A job that slowly kills you. Bruises that won't heal. You look so tired, unhappy. Bring down the government. They don't, they don't speak for us. I'll take a quiet life. A handshake of carbon monoxide. And no alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises. Silent, silent. This is my final fit. My final bellyache with. No alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises, please. Such a pretty house. And such a pretty garden. No alarms and no surprises.

Paranoid Android,"Please, could you stop the noise?. I'm trying to get some rest. From all the unborn chicken voices. In my head. What's that?. (I may be paranoid, but not an android). What's that?. (I may be paranoid, but not an android). When I am king. You will be first against the wall. With your opinion. Which is of no consequence at all. What's that?. (I may be paranoid, but no android). What's that?. (I may be paranoid, but no android). Ambition makes you look pretty ugly. Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy. You don't remember, you don't remember. Why don't you remember my name?. Off with his head, man, off with his head, man. Why don't you remember my name?. I guess he does. Rain down, rain down. Come on, rain down on me. From a great height. From a great height, height. Rain down, rain down. Come on, rain down on me. From a great height. From a great height, height. That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down).

Exit Music (For A Film),"Wake from your sleep. The drying of your tears. Today we escape, we escape. Pack and get dressed. Before your father hears us. Before all hell breaks loose. Breathe, keep breathing. Don't lose your nerve. Breathe, keep breathing. I can't do this alone. Sing us a song. A song to keep us warm. There's such a chill. Such a chill. And you can laugh a spineless laugh. We hope your rules and wisdom choke you. Now we are one in everlasting peace. We hope that you choke, that you choke. We hope that you choke. That you choke. We hope that you choke. That you choke"
Fake Plastic Trees,A green plastic watering can. For a fake Chinese rubber plant. In a fake plastic earth. That she bought from a rubber man. In a town full of rubber plants. To get rid of itself. It wears her out. It wears her out. It wears her out. It wears her out. She lives with a broken man. A cracked polystyrene man. Who just crumbles and burns. He used to do surgery. For girls in the eighties. But gravity always wins. And it wears him out. It wears him out. It wears him out. It wears. She looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing. My fake plastic love. But I can't help the feeling. I could blow through the ceiling. If I just turn and run. And it wears me out. It wears me out. It wears me out. It wears me out. And if I could be who you wanted. If I could be who you wanted. All the time. All the time

High and Dry,"Two jumps in a week, I bet you. Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy. Flying on your motorcycle. Watching all the ground beneath you drop. You'd kill yourself for recognition. Kill yourself to never, ever stop. You broke another mirror. You're turning into something you are not. Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. Drying up in conversation. You will be the one who cannot talk. All your insides fall to pieces. You just sit there wishing you could still make love. They're the ones who'll hate you.

Let Down,"Transport, motorways and tramlines. Starting and then stopping. Taking off and landing. The emptiest of feelings. Disappointed people. Clinging on to bottles. And when it comes it's so, so disappointing. Let down and hanging around. Crushed like a bug in the ground. Let down and hanging around. Shell smashed, juices flowing. Wings twitch, legs are going. Don't get sentimental. It always ends up drivel. One day I am gonna grow wings. A chemical reaction. Hysterical and useless. Hysterical and. Let down and hanging around. Crushed like a bug in the ground. Let down and hanging around. Let down again. Let down again. Let down again. You know, you know where you are with. You know where you are with. Floor collapsing.

Burn the Witch,"Stay in the shadows. Cheer at the gallows. This is a round-up. This is a low-flying panic attack. Sing the song on the jukebox that goes. Burn the witch. Burn the witch.

Decks Dark,"Then into your life, there comes a darkness. There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky. And there's nowhere to hide. You run to the back and you cover your ears. But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard. And all we trapped rag doll cloth people. We are helpless to resist. Into our darkest hour. But it was just a laugh, just a laugh. Just a laugh, just a laugh. Even at this angle. And so we crumble. A ten ton head, made of wet sand. Oh, this dread circumference. You've gotta be kidding me. The grass grows over me. Your face in the glass, in the glass. It was just a laugh, just a laugh. It's whatever you say it is. In split infinity. Then into your life, there comes a darkness. And a spacecraft blocking out the sky. And there's nowhere to hide. You run to the back and you cover your ears. But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard. Into your darkest hour.

Jigsaw Falling Into Place,"Just as you take my hand. Just as you write my number down. Just as the drinks arrive. Just as they play your favourite song. As your bad day disappears. No longer wound up like a spring. Before you had too much. Come back in focus again. The walls abandon shape. They've got a Cheshire cat grin. All blurring into one. This place is on a mission. Before the night owl. Before the animal noises. Closed circuit cameras. Before you're comatose. Before you run away from me. Before you're lost between the notes. The beat goes 'round and 'round. The beat goes 'round and 'round. I never really got there. I just pretended that I had. Words are blunt instruments. Words are sawn-off shotguns. Come on and let it out. Come on and let it out. Come on and let it out. Come on and let it out. Before you run away from me. Before you're lost between the notes. Just as you take the mic. Just as you dance, dance, dance.

Climbing up the walls. Climbing up the walls. *scream*

Subterranean Homesick Alien,"The breath of the morning I keep forgetting. The smell of the warm summer air. I live in a town where you can't smell a thing. You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement. Up above aliens hover. Making home movies for the folks back home. Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits. Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets. They're all uptight, uptight. Uptight, uptight. Uptight, uptight. I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane. Late at night when I'm driving. Take me on board their beautiful ship. Show me the world as I'd love to see it. I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me. They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely. I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life. They'd shut me away but I'd be alright, alright. Mom, I'm alright, alright. I'm just uptight, uptight. Uptight, uptight. Uptight, uptight. Uptight, uptight. Uptight"

He cursed and then he cried. And the hanging man held out his hand. And looked beyond the sky. The thief that climbed the cross. ""We should have shared that other's fate."". But the Jesus man said ""Not now"". ""My brother, not now, it's far too late!"". (far too late) (7x). Do what you must. Take what you can. Steal the pride from every heart. Every angered man (3x). I am the thief. I am the thief. And you will run. Yes and you will hide. But I'll get you then. Yes I will. Because of you, because it's justified. I will get you yet. Cause it's justified. I will get you yet. It's justified. I will get you yet. It's justified"
Nothing Touches Me,"Nothing touches me man. These walls are three feet thick. Wouldn't take one of them little drills. To get through it. I try to make her listen. When I turn away she's split. I try to make her listen. When I turn away she's split. She went... Nothing touches me now. Nothing touches me now. Nothing touches me man. No matter how you split. Sticks and stones can get through bones. So I've given up looking out of it. I try to make her listen. When I turn away she's split. I try to make her listen. When I turn away she's split. She went... Nothing touches me now. Nothing touches me now. Nothing touches me now. Nothing touches me now. Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now. Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now. Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now. Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now"
The Jumbled Words of Climbing up the Walls Read by Little Dan Clements,"That keeps your toys in the basement. And if you get too far inside. You'll find you came out where you went in. So tuck the kids in safe tonight. And shut the eyes in the cupboard. I am the weapon that you needed. Keep an eye out for the neighbours. Anyway you turn. I'll be there. Open your skull. I'll be there. Climbing up the walls. I am the club and carving knife. We are friends til we die. You should not walk alone at night. You must show me your care. In the time when the lights go out. I am her face when she sleeps. I can't remember how it happened. Fifteen blows to the brain. I am the face on the news. I will strike when the- I will strike anytime. I will knock fifteen times. I have the smell of a local man. I can strike anytime. I am the pick in the ice in the quiet country lanes. I am the newspaper round. I am the eyes in the cupboard. I am the creak in the floorboards. I am the crack of the hammer. Overhead powerlines. I am the old, frightened. I am the years, ever... poording. (Ever parading). Ever parading. (Ok, thanks Dan)"

Ed’s Scary Song,"And we beg for the scraps from your table. All we want is to be like you. Music to play your ___. Pump pumping sounds through the speakers below. Hello. I've tried so hard to keep still. They will chew you up. They will spit out your bones. Standing in the shadows at the end of the bed. I never said anything. I live a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a band. It seems so volatile. Oh my, oh my. He was a good man. And he said he was the best. They said that even when life spat in his face. He put everything back in its right place. A conflict of interest, you might say. Are you trying to bribe me?. _____ for my sins. We are plants, happy plants. Superhuman builders' day. See. ____________. I leave you for bitch of _____ and go green. Loved to death like egg mayonnaise. With a grin like roadkill. Fine, let's stay. Everything is alive. There is nothing but blue skies from now on. No ghosts, no skeletons. A man hovers in the dust, dust, dust."
Open the Floodgates,Get to the chorus. Open the floodgates. We want the good bits. Without the bullshit. And no heartache. Hold on. Hold on. No pain and. No suffering. And no one gets hurt. We absorb you. We absolve you. Open the floodgates. Hold on. Hold on
